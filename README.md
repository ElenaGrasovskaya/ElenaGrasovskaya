-  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElenaGrasovskaya and currently, I'm making an attempt to teach myself web development. Since I have an engineering background I have always dealt with technology and web programming seems a fine combination of beauty and order, so I could use it to build something useful and elegant both inside and outside, provided my proficiency would have got to the appropriate level.
