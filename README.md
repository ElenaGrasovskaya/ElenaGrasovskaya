- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElenaGrasovskaya and currently I'm making an attempt to teach myself web development. Since I have an engineering background I always dealt with technology, but web programming for me is a fine combination of beauty and order so I really hope to succeed in getting my proficiency to the appropriate level for building something really useful and elegant both inside and outside.
